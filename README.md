# Bootfy Skripts Repository

## What is this?
This is a repository with all bootfy skripts or "mods" so that you can install them via an app.


## How can I upload my skript?
Create an issue with the file attached. Include a description and a title. It will be added when I can.

## Spec

1. Fetch `list.json`
2. Make list by name & description
3. Fetch `key['url']` to download skript

I don't even know what's going on with map packs, just feel it out.
